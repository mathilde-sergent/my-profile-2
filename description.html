			<h1> Who am I ?</h1>
			<div class="espace"></div>
			<p> My name is Mathilde and I live next to La DÃ©fense. I grew up in a little city next to Disneyland Paris. I am 18 years old and I am the youngest in my family. I study in a school of management called IESEG, in Paris. I have wanted to study in this school since the beginning of high school. When I finish my studies, I want to work in the advertising market. Last summer, I worked in a restaurant as a receptionist during 2 months. It was my first job and I learned a lot about working. It helped me grow and be more sociable. During my free time, I love watching movies, listenning to music and spending time with my friends and family. I also practice sport 3 times a week and I play music. Learning new languages is one of my passion. This passion grew in me thanks to the trips I did. I travelled several times to the United States of America: I went there twice with my family and twice by myself (I was hosted by an American family). I also had the chance to travel to Cuba, Spain, Italy, England and Germany. These experiences helped me improve my English and it also made me grow up and be more open-minded.</p>
